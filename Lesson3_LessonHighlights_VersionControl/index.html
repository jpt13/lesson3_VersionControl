            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The biggest highlight of all in this lesson, in my opinion, teaches us what Version Control actually is. Version Control is essentially a system that keeps track of every version of a file you are working on. Sometimes, without version control, documents on computers (or versions of those documents) can be easily lost. With version control, this would never occur as all versions of your file will be saved to  a remote location (called a repository). The version control system we are beginning to learn in this lession is GitHub. While it has some unique features about it, all verion control systems serve virtually the same purpose.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The main thing that one has to understand, right off the bat about Git, is that it views your different versions of a file as snapshots of that file at a given time you are working on it. This is different than other verison control systems, and grants Git with the power to do more than its counterparts. Git also is able to use files on your local disk to preform operations and doesn't necessarily need to always communicate with the remote repository, this can be very helpful when offline and offers another advantage over other version control systems. The last important thing to know about Git is that it has 3 stages: the working directory, the staging area, and the Git directory. You work on a file in the working directory, then you stage the files (adding that snapshot to the staging area), and finally you commit those files which saves the snapshots to the Git directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working on documents on our own computers, a very common technique to use is to "save as" each version of your file with a different yet similar name so one can keep track of all their work. There are two main problems one can run into using this system. The first, is when you are working with hundreds of versions of a file. It would become extremely overwheliming to keep track of your versions in this manner working with hundreds of them. Also, this method does not solve the problem of if something happens to your computer. You would lose all of those versions of the file if one day the computer they are all saved on crashed. Version control systems make this process a lot easier by organizing your saved versions for you and also if a remote repository is utilized, your files will be safe even if the local disk becomes inoperable.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Working with a team</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the most important and useful advantages of using a version control system is the ability to make working on the same file with others simple. Using a remote repository enables teams of developers to easily keep track of versions of their files even when 2 or more people are working on the samer version of a file at the same time on different computers. There is no overwriting with version control systems, each user gets their own copy of the version of the file, this allows developers to work at the same time on the same version of the same file without confict. They are also given the power to merge versions of files together to make a new version. Utilizing VCS solves the issue of coding with a team.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are some important git commants to know at the very begnning of learning how to utilize the system: git init [project name] sets up a local repository for a given project. git add [file] takes a snapshot of the project to be saved to the repository. git status shows all files ready to be committed to the repository. git commit -m "[descriptive message]" saves the snapshot (version of the file) permanently to the repository. git push takes the commited file on the local repository and saves it to a remote repository. There are other important commands such as git diff which shows the file differences, but those git commands provided in this passage are the first important ones a beginner should learn. </p>
